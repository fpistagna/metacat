**MetaCat** is a specialized, cloud-native backend service designed to create and manage a catalog of metadata for **scientific products**. It exposes a **_pragmatic_** **REST-like API** for the entire lifecycle of research metadata‚Äîfrom creation to publication‚Äîstrictly following the **[DataCite Metadata Kernel v4.6](https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.6/)**. Each metadata record is linked to a scientific product (such as a dataset, software, or publication) via a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

This project originated as a research and development case study. It is provided to the community under the **AGPL-3.0 License** as both a research product and a foundation for new implementations, offered "AS IS", without any warranty.

The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, featuring a complete JWT and OAuth2 (ORCID) authentication and role-based authorization system, ready for containerized deployment with Docker.

## ‚ú® Features

* **DataCite Schema v4.6**: Full CRUD support for records compliant with the latest DataCite standard.
* **Hybrid Authentication**:
    * Local user registration (`username`/`password`).
    * **OAuth2** integration with **ORCID** (Sandbox & Production).
    * Secure session management using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
* **Role-Based Authorization (RBAC)**:
    * Pre-defined roles (`user`, `curator`, `admin`) with granular permissions.
    * Record ownership rules and a full publication workflow (`draft` -> `published`).
* **Advanced Querying**:
    * Full-text search across indexed metadata fields.
    * Advanced filtering on record properties (e.g., publication status, owner).
* **Professional Architecture**:
    * Clean, layered architecture (Routes, Controllers, Services, DAO/Repository, Models).
    * Robust, centralized error handling with custom error classes.
    * Modern asynchronous code with `async/await` and reusable wrappers.
    * Strong input validation with **AJV** and a full suite of JSON Schemas.
* **DevOps & Tooling**:
    * Full **Docker & Docker Compose** setup for the entire stack (Backend, MongoDB, Nginx Proxy).
    * Automated database migrations with **Umzug**.
    * Interactive API documentation via **Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0**.
    * Comprehensive testing suite using **Mocha & Chai** (functional, integration, and unit tests).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* npm
* Docker & Docker Compose
* `openssl` (for generating local SSL certificates)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file. Then, fill in the required values.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Now edit the .env file with your secrets and configuration
    ```

4.  **Set up Local HTTPS with Nginx:**
    This project uses an Nginx reverse proxy to provide HTTPS for local development (required by ORCID OAuth2).
    
    * **Generate SSL certificate:**
        ```bash
        openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
          -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt \
          -subj "/C=IT/ST=State/L=City/O=Dev/CN=localhost"
        ```
    * **Start the full stack (Nginx, Backend, DB):**
        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build
        ```
    The API will now be available at `https://localhost`.

5.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    Before starting, apply any pending database migrations.
    ```bash
    npm run migrate:up
    ```

### Running the App
* **For development (with hot-reloading via nodemon):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
* **For production:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

## üìñ API Documentation

This project uses Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive API documentation. Once the server is running, access it at:
**[https://localhost/api-docs](https://localhost/api-docs)**



You can test all endpoints directly from this interface, including the authenticated ones using the "Authorize" button.

---

## üß™ Running Tests

The test suite uses Mocha and Chai. The test database is configured separately via your `.env` file for the `test` environment.

* **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
* **Run specific test suites:**
    ```bash
    # Run only authentication tests
    npm run test:auth

    # Run only migration tests
    npm run test:migration
    ```
